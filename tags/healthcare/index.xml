This process is characterized by several sub-processes, including ventricular bending, ventricular rotation, and displacement of embryonic heart segments along the cranio-caudal body axis. Abnormalities in heart looping process can lead to congenital heart defects, which occur in approximately 1% of live births and 10% of stillborn human births, and may also be cause of spontaneous abortions in the first trimester of pregnancy.</description></item></channel></rss>
