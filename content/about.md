### Hello there! 

I'm Michaela, a recent **Bioengineering** alumnus from **Imperial College London**. My passions lie in the realms of *software engineering, data analysis, healthcare* and *biotechnology*.


When I'm not buried in data or tinkering with software, you'll most likely find me in the kitchen! Cooking and baking are my go-to hobbies â€” I even had the absolute honour to intern  at one of my all time favorite bakeries in London, [Crumbs&Doilies](https://www.crumbsanddoilies.co.uk/). 

And when I'm not whipping up something delicious, I'm exploring my creative side, dabbling in painting and losing myself in a good book.
